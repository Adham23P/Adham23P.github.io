								<h2 class="major">Intro</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/IMG_5045(1).jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I am an 4th year computer science student at George Washington University. My coding journey started in 10th grade with an introductory class to CS. I continued onto a more advanced course in 11th grade that was not my expectation based on what I learned the prior year. Introductory data structures and other logic puzzles made me wonder how deep the iceberg of CS could go. After junior year, I re-evaluated my interests senior year of high school and decided to pursue CS in college (I was looking towards economics and different engineering disclipines before my decision).
									Luckily, I now know I made the right choice. As I continue through the curriculum, my appreciation and interest in the field continues to grow. Never would I have imagined all the underlying algorithms, math, and work being used so widely in my daily life. CS has given me the ability to critically think in 
									a way I have never been able to before. I enjoy learning new things, and I now see that there are infinite things to learn in the field. There will never be a point where I feel like I have learned enough
									CS and coding have changed my life in that I will always be learning and I find that amazing.</p>
								<p>Some interests I want to pursue more strongly within the field as I grow are distributed computing, low-level programming (embedded systems/kernel development), machine learning, and data management/databases. A detailed look at some of my projects and ongoing work can be found <a href="#projects">here</a>. My <a href="#resume">resume</a> summarizes my all work, skills and academic career at GW.
									Ultimately, my goal for the next 5-10 years is to be able to design a robust, efficient, and cost-effective system as a system architect. Graduate school has also been a factor in my plans with either a 5th-year at GW or a different school later in my career. </p>

							<article id = "projects">
								<h2 class="major">Projects</h2>
								<h3>BikeBuddy: Senior Year Capstone</h3>
								<h4><i>Use of: Python, React-Native, AWS (S3, API Gateway, Lambda) </i></h4>
								<span class="image main"><a href="enlargedBikeBuddy.html"><img src="images/BikeBuddyArch.jpg" alt="" />Enlarge/Enhance</a></span>
								<span class="image main"><a href="enlargedBikeBuddyMap.html"><img src="images/BikeBuddyMap.png" alt="" height="800" />Enlarge/Enhance</a></span>
								<p>(TO BE UPDATED) Mobile application that focuses on routes specifically for bikes in Washington, D.C. Python OSMNX library was used to get a base graph representation of the city. API calls to OpenData D.C. Datasets are the utilized in the creation of the graph and weight modificaiton for
									bike routes returned from out AWS lambda function. Bike lane information is retrieved from OpenData D.C. and bike lanes are overlayed onto our graph which is further reduced to nodes at each intersection.
									Identifying nearest edges in a graph involved the combination of a hashmap-like data structure with a cKDTree (insertion based on coordinates that allows for O(log(n)) searching on those coordinates) to properly find edges quickly. 
									Current work is being done that will include weight modification to edges based on crime, safety, and traffic. Bike rack functionality is also actively being worked on, as well as refining the current user experience. 
								</p>
								<h3>News App Android</h3>
								<h4><i>Use of: Kotlin in Android Studio IDE</i></h4>
								<video width = 560 controls>
									<source src="video/Demo_Project1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
								  Your browser does not support the video tag.
								  </video>
								<p>News can be obtained through a term search with the choice to filter based on a spcific source and by filtering by category. News can also be obtained through
									a long click on the google map provided. Finally, news can also be obtained thorugh the current top headlines and category selected. This project utilized the following API: https://newsapi.org/.
									The app properly works by disabling buttons based on current user behavior and by also removing invalid article results. Shared Preferences properly save the previous location and term searched. 
									The video above best demonstrates the full user experience of the application.
								</p>
								<h3>Straggler Mitigation</h3>
								<h4><i>Use of: Python, Docker, AWS (EC2)</i></h4>
								<span class="image main"><a href="enlargedStraggler.html"><img src="images/StragglerDiagram.png" alt="" />Enlarge/Enhance</a></span>
								<p>Distributed ML training using PyTorch and RingAllreduce architecture. Stragglers were simulated and cut out based on varying 
									conditions of completion and its lag compared to other workers. After aggregation occurs and each local model is updated, 
									the straggler is added back into the ring architecture and training from each worker continues as normal. Performance was increased with
									 minimal model degradation from dropped gradients from stragglers with credit card data set. </p>
								<h3>Debate Winner Predictor</h3>
								<h4><i>Use of: Python (through JupyterLab)</i></h4>
								<span class="image main"><a href="enlargedML.html"><img src="images/machine learning.png" alt="" />Enlarge/Enhance</a><script src="assets/js/script.js"></script></span> 
								<p>Machine learning project which achieved final 78% accuracy in prediction of the winner of APDA debates. 
									Decision tree was initially implemented with slightly lower accuracy. 
									Data was gathered from PDF tabcards and transformed properly using dataframes for feature calculation of the models. The final most accurate model used Support Vector Machines. </p>
								<h3>Database Translation: JSON to SQL</h3>
								<h4><i>Use of: Python (through JupyterLab), SQLite, LucidChart (ER Diagrams)</i></h4>
								<span class="image main"><a href="enlargedSQL.html"><img src="images/SQL_GithubEvents.png" alt="" />Enlarge/Enhance</a><script src="assets/js/script.js"></script></span> 
								<p>Migration of JSON/noSQL based data to and fully realized SQL database. The GitHubEvents API was used and analyzed to first construct ER diagrams. After a few models and revisions, the ER diagrams were used to make a formal schema and SQL script that avoids as much duplication as possible. Python was utilized to collect and parse the data to be properly insert into this SWL schema. This project was crucial in my understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of semi-structured vs. structured data. </p>
								<h3>Microkernal Containers</h3>
								<h4><i>Use of: C </i></h4>
								<span class="image main"><a href="enlargedKernel.html"><img src="images/MicroKernel.png" alt="" />Enlarge/Enhance</a><script src="assets/js/script.js"></script></span> 
								<p>Implementation of containers in xv6 (microkernel operating system). Involved using shared memory with process mutex locks to communicate between a server and a client for starting a container. Preprocessing to start a container involved parsing, enforcing resource limitation, and setting a root in the filesystem. Priority scheduling was implemented for the containers to run above other processes. Involved modifications on both kernel and user-level with new system calls created to manage processes and sensitive actions. </p>
								<h3>GUI Client and Server</h3>
								<h4><i>Use of: Java</i></h4>
								<span class="image main"><a href="enlargedClient.html"><img src="images/ClientServer.png" alt="" />Enlarge/Enhance</a><script src="assets/js/script.js"></script></span> 
								<p>A threaded GUI client program utilizing socket objects in Java to connect to a server chatroom. Updates members as they join and leave the server and allows a user to output via direct messaging or to all other online users. The server adds and removes clients as they enter and leave the room with a Linked List being used to maintain direct messaging between clients.</p>
								<h3>University Registration-Advising System</h3>
								<h4><i>Use of: Python+Flask, HTML+CSS, mySQL (hosted on AWS)</i></h4>
								<span class="image main"><a href="enlargedUni.html"><img src="images/student-dashboard.png" alt="" />Enlarge/Enhance</a><script src="assets/js/script.js"></script></span>
								<p>University System that maintains student records and assigned faculty advisors. Different permissions given based on user login which also includes faculty advisors and graduation secretaries who can view transcripts, approve applications to graduate, and assign grades to students who are registered for their specific course. Rate-my-professor functionality implemented and usable by students once a course has a grade confirmed in their self-created program of study.</p>
								<h3>Mini Shell</h3>
								<h4><i>Use of: C</i></h4>
								<span class="image main"><a href="enlargedPipe.html"><img src="images/pipes.png" alt="" />Enlarge/Enhance</a><script src="assets/js/script.js"></script></span>
								<p>A fully usable shell that makes use of system calls such as fork, dup, and exec. Parses user input at the command line and supports pipes by overwriting file descriptors of processes. Job control uses signals to support background tasks. File redirections can output stderr and stdout to a specified file.</p>
								<h3>Retro Video Game Store</h3>
								<h4><i>Use of: Python+Flask, HTML+CSS, SQLite </i></h4>
								<span class="image main"><a href="enlargedTech.html"><img src="images/shoppingcart.png" alt="" />Enlarge/Enhance</a><script src="assets/js/script.js"></script></span>
								<p>An online store that uses SQLite to store products and user information. Use of Python + Flask as backend to support proper insertion and updates to the database. Use of session variables to maintain user login and current products in the cart before checkout. Website is properly maintained by subtracting stock as orders are completed and by updating order history for customers.</p>
